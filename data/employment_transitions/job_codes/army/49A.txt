Description:
The ORSAs introduce quantitative analysis to the military decision-making processes.

Conduct analysis across the spectrum of military activities; perform research and analysis of practical and theoretical issues regarding combat operations, doctrine, tactics, system effectiveness, force design, force structure, and the deployment and employment of weapon systems; analyze military recruiting, retention, strength, mobilization, personnel, training, and structure issues for both active and reserve components; determine optimal resource management and allocation strategies through analyses of force structure, manpower requirements, authorizations, personnel developments, materiel acquisition, and logistics programs; conduct conceptual studies and analyses of major Army and Department of Defense programs dealing with alternative military strategies, force designs, strategic force issues, logistics management, weapon systems, and their associated resource management implications; design tests and experiments for complex weapon systems and future combat developments concepts within materiel acquisition and force development processes; determines measures of effectiveness, applies risk analysis, analyzes and interprets empirical data, and obtains objective data for acquisition decisions, studies, training evaluations, system comparisons, analytic models, and combat simulations; serve on senior level Army, Defense, and Joint staffs conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis to support commanders; instruct other officers in ORSA, Systems Engineering, and mathematics; integrates military knowledge and experience with the scientific and managerial fields; serve as subject matter experts in designing forces, allocating resources, analyzing effects, performing course of action and trade-off analysis, and they effectively communicate potential solutions to complex problems to decision makers.
